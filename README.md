# RapidSDK
RapidSDK is a Backend as a Service platform that eliminates the need for app developers to build custom backend solutions for their apps. Development of server-side components is expensive, repetitive, and distracts from perfecting your app. Let RapidSDK handle it so you can focus on making your app awesome.
